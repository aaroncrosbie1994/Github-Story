<h1>An Average Day of College</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>You arrive to college at roughly 9.30am, nerves begin to rise as you stare down the double door
    to the lecture hall. After wiping the sweat from your brow you muster the courage and swing open
    the door, all eyes fall upon you and to make matters worse as you enter the room you notice just
    to your right the lecturer is staring right at you with a cold look almost questioning why you'd
    bother coming late.
