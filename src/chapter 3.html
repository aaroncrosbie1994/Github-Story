<h1>An Average Day of College</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>After hurrying out the lecture room doors the only thought that is going through your head is your desperate need for
    a coffee, the canteen is only a 5 minute walk away but to you that's 5 minutes you just don't know if you can wait.
    The long walk across campus has really taken it out of you and now you find yourself at an impasse, do you go home?
    Or do you ride out the oncoming storm of labs and additional lectures. You drink your cappuccino hoping it will give
    you the energy to keep on going but alas your lack of sleep has proven too much. The shear exhaustion has hit you
    with the intensity of a Vulcan death grip and the thoughts of going on for another four hours proves too much for you.
    With that you gather your belongings, not paying attention to the fact everyone sitting at the table is currently looking
    at you.
