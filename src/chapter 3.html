<h1>An Average Day of College</h1>
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>After hurrying out the lecture room doors the only thought that is going through your head is your desperate need for
    a coffee, the canteen is only a 5 minute walk away but to you that's 5 minutes you just don't know if you can wait.
    The long walk across campus has really taken it out of you and now you find yourself at an impasse, do you go home?
    Or do you ride out the oncoming storm of labs and additional lectures. You drink your cappuccino hoping it will give
    you the energy to keep on going but alas your lack of sleep has proven too much. The shear exhaustion has hit you
    with the intensity of a Vulcan death grip and the thoughts of going on for another four hours proves too much for you.
    With that you gather your belongings, not paying attention to the fact everyone sitting at the table is currently looking
    at you. After realising everyone is essentially staring into your soul you come to one conclusion, you must come up with
    an excuse to get out of this living torment. In the most casual way possible you go on to say how this lecture is in fact
    a waste of time and that you'd rather be at home doing work for assignments. They've bought it and with that you skip out
    of F block knowing quite well there will be no college work done today but instead you'll be picking up right where you
    left off before leaving the house this morning.
